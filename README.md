- 👋 Hi, I’m @Venn-hub and my nickname is usually "Vennele", some combinations of letters that sounded nice in my mind. Once the curiosity was bigger than me, what if it means something? That crossed my mind. (Well, if you Google Translate it, it's a nice surprise). "Vennele" does mean something at the end and it's deeply related with me in a way or another.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Too many things, being honest. In order they appear my mind: Music, humanity, money, videogames, philosophy, education and "skills needed to conquer the world and make it better in the process".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to play the guitar, and kindergarten coding if that's a thing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything related to education that I'm able to find. (I'll need a couple years before I'm actually able to contribute, however I do expect sooner than later! It's a matter of time).
- 📫 How to reach me ... Discord is the way! Vennele#6102 is my tag. I'm more likely to respond there than in my gmail, facebook, twitter or whatever. Don't be shy to say hi, it will be a pleasure to chat for a while if we're available to do so.
